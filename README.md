# JupyterLab-WEkEO

Throughout the [Artificial Intelligence for Earth Monitoring MOOC](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/artificial-intelligence-for-earth-monitoring), there is hands-on tutorials where you can have a go yourself at using AI and ML algorithms to analyse Earth observation data (from the Copernicus programme). These practical elements of the course will take the form of Jupyter Notebooks, which work like documents containing both rich-text (such as paragraphs and links) and computer code, in this case Python, and the code can be run which will output results (such as graphs and tables).

## Getting Started

### Description

### Installing and downloading the material

To clone this repository in your laptop, type:

```
    git clone [https://github.com/wekeo/ai4EM_MOOC.git](https://github.com/wekeo/ai4EM_MOOC.git)
```

NOTE: You would not have the fast access provided by the Harmonized Data Access as part of the WEkEO infrastructure if you want to execute in youe own local machine.

In case you want to copy the repository in a local folder of your Gitlab, you would need to register for a [WEkEO](www.wekeo.eu) account and enter the JupyterHub - then follow the instructions below.

If you are currently on the WEkEO JupyterLab you are already in the right place and can start. To clone this repository in to the WEkEO JupyterLab environment open a terminal in the WEkEO JupyterLab, type:

```
    cd work
    git clone [https://github.com/wekeo/ai4EM_MOOC.git](https://github.com/wekeo/ai4EM_MOOC.git)
```

This will create a clone of this repository of notebooks in the work directory on your JupyterHub instance. You can use the same shell script to clone any external repository you like.
